# Ohio North SQL Saturday 2023 Postmortem

## Good Things
- We had over 100 attendees
- Printing 
  - We only need 600 evals
- Speakers, sponsors, attendees were happy
- Facility - Bounce Innovation Hub
  - Good for the size
  - Not renting tables/chairs
  - Were able to get in early Friday to setup 
- Everything went smoothly - no tech problems, wifi was good (once up and running)
- New speakers, good variety of topics
- Lunch was good. Need to ask better about how much food per person, be clearer with setup times.
- Sessionize is great

## Bad Things
- We lost $2k
- Bounce size limited attendee and sponsor size
- May is a terrible month to host an event in (prom, graduation, Cleveland Marathon, etc...)
- Badge stuffing and cutting evals took longer than we thought
- Didn't get enough attendees for Tutorials
- Akron was far for some of us (except Eddie!)
- Hotels for speakers were far
- Need more attendees (70 attendees, 5 board, 5 sponsor, 20 speakers)
- Eventbrite is too expensive

## Things to remember for next time
- February date
- Flip the LLC - Ohio North Data Training
  - Do we need to expand past "SQL Saturday"? Data Saturday? MSFT only gives money with SQL Saturday
    - If we get other groups: SUPER DATA SATURDAY
  - Do we want to expand and bring in other groups as well (Big data, python, R, C#, DS?) More work, but more ability to reach a larger audience
- Start planning in August
- Talk to Aaron from BW for a space
- Create a sponsor info page (one available on SQLSaturday.com FAQs)
- Create a speaker info page - hotels, travel, things to do
- FIND MORE SPONSORS $$$$
- Advertise on Slack Data community
- Have a good speaker from Big Data Meetup and have them do a 1 hour session at our group
- Figure out raffle system (no paper names/emails). QR code, have the sponsors download an app.
- We should have an event eval - put one in each badge and collect at the end. Need a raffle for this.
- Add speaker evals online. Evals can be a raffle. At least be clearer with eval instructions - give to speaker.
- Need 6 people to cut badges - 2 to cut, 2 to stuff, 2 to arrange
- Sessions that aren't just a 1 hour deep dive - lightning talks, social stuff, trivia game, etc..
