# Meeting Runbook

This is a runbook for leading the meeting so I don't forget any important information.

## Social Hour
- Welcome newcomers.
- Announce verbally or in chat:
  > Welcome to the ONDT Meeting. 5-6pm is our social hour, with main pressentation starting at 6pm.

## Meeting
- Quick overview of the group and meeting times
  > Welcome, if you are new we meet the first Tuesday of every month. Online for now, occasionally outdoors in the Metroparks when it warms up, hybrid in-person once we locate a meeting space.
  
  > If you want to receive notifications of our monthly events and aren't already signed up, visit https://www.meetup.com/ohio-north-database-training/

- Review upcoming educational opportunities:
  - https://sqlsaturday.com

- Ask if there are any job openings?
- Ask if there are any other meeting items that need discussion?

## Main Presentation
- Ask the speaker before they start:
  > Would you like people to speak up with questions as they come up or wait until the end?
