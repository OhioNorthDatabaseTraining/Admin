Notes
===
- Presentation Schedule - who's coming up?
  - Jeff Iannucci (May) - Communication does and donts
  - Allan Hirt (June)
  - Paul Popovich (August) - Azure Data Factory
  - Other topics/speakers suggested: Kimberly or Paul on whatever, Azure topics, Hasan on Cosmos, Hugo or Grant on Execution Plans, Bob Ward on whatever
  - September meeting - maybe do it outside at a pavillion/shelter? Lightning talks, or just social gathering if in-person seems feasible, ALlen has a presentation idea he could present
- Pre- and Post- meeting chats - professionalism
  - Need to work on being more welcoming.  Need to make everyone feel comfortable (especially since virtual meetings bring lots of non-locals), fewer "inside joke" conversations in the pre/post chats
  - Need to be less personal in our conversations (especially Pre-), try to include more of the remote attendees
    - Idea: Share a slide with guidelines, what's going on,  
- SQL Saturday - Virtual - Steve Jones' request
  - Should we do a virtual session? No - everyone feels burned out on virtual
- SQL Saturday - In Person - comfort for early 2022?
  - Book venue by late summer, plan to wait and see how COVID building capacity limits play out
  - Can we skip lunch? Can we put up a donation jar in case we don't get sponsor funding (who knows what marketing budgets will look like)
  - Revisit in August and make a decision there
- Azure Data Community Update
  - Picking 5 users to attend office hours meetings, switch to Teams
  - Notify user group in May meeting that we might be switching to Teams
